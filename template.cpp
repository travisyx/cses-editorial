        The following two lines of code makes I/O more efficient. The default
        configuration for C++ is that if a C++ stream object (i.e. cin) is
        mixed with a C stream object (i.e. scanf()), the two streams will be
        synced, which can be slower. The first line disables this. 

        Then, C++ also generally ties together the input and output streams
        (cin and cout) together. This means that the program will wait for the
        output to be flushed and appears before any more input is presented.
        The second line unties these, which can be faster.
